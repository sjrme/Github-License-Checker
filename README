To run the app, open the command line from the main folder and run python3 gui.py. 
Fill out the form as given:
    Username -- Github username of the owner of the organization/user with access to organization
    Organization -- Name of the organization to be searched
    Password -- Password associated with the username given in the first line
    
After clicking the "Look for licenses" button, all public and private repositories will
be displayed, followed by the license the repository publishes. If a repository does not have a license,
a button labeled "Add license" will be displayed on the side. 

The add license button will:
    Create a new branch called "LicenseBranch," on the Github repository.
    Add the MIT open source license, with the organization name, to the new branch.
    Open a pull request to merge LicenseBranch with the master branch.

The program requires the python package "requests," which may be installed with pip:
    pip install requests

I originally considered making two separate options for searching through Github organizations:
Searching only public repos for licenses, and searching both public and private repos. This option was removed 
later, as it did not seem to fit well with the second part (where licenses are added to repos), which always
requires a password. The program, then, assumes that the indivual making the search owns or has direct access to
the organization attatched to the search. The functionality also assumes that organizations are the only account types that
will be searched -- private accounts cannot be searched.
